# Seminar - Data Behind Music

## Dataset

The dataset can be found here: http://mir.ilsp.gr/track_popularity.html

## Methodology

- **Task 1:** Investigate relationships between rankings. Determine if artists have the same positions across different ranking lists
- **Task 2:**  Explore similarity and identify outliers—less famous artists who share similarities with more famous artists
- **Task 3:** Analyze and compare the decline in popularity of tracks and artists, using either position (numerical or binary presence in rankings) or the number of listeners

For Each Task:

- General analysis
- Case-specific analysis for three artists or songs
- Outlier analysis
